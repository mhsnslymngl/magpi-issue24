As soon as the Raspberry Pi was launched, Allen Heard, Head of Computing and IT at Ysgol Bryn Elian, was keen to get started with this awesome innovation. The Raspberry Pi plays a key role in the school's Tech-Dojo events that have seen over 150 children, parents and teachers attend fun packed days on a Saturday.  These days have included learning about coding, electronics, Minecraft and App building.

The Tech-Dojo events have won the school an award for Digital Projects that engage with the local community through the annual  North Wales 14-19 e-learning competition.  Digital Literacy is almost a given in today’s society, however computing is less so.  The aim of our sector-leading Tech-Dojo sessions is to introduce the latest technology to the local community, including all stakeholders.  Be it current students, primary children, home educated children, parents and even other teachers as a means of CPD, we introduce them to the possibilities of computing through a range of fun activities. We use Raspberry Pi’s extensively to introduce visual & text based coding and add electronics into the mix so participants can light up bulbs and code real working circuits. We promote the events through local primary schools, Twitter, and the Tech-Dojo App. 

Children attend from schools across North Wales as well as teachers looking for CPD, we have also had members of the LEA attend to experience our success for themselves. These sessions are ultimately aimed at raising awareness of the possibilities of using Raspberry Pi's, Scratch, Minecraft, and App building tools, to help children realise the possibilities of being skilled in these areas. In doing so, we begin to raise the aspirations of the young people in our community.

 We pride ourselves on having staff with the expertise, motivation, and enthusiasm in the field of computing to be able to make a difference to the community through our inclusive attitude towards engaging with them. Whether it be transition children or otherwise. For us, it's all about getting technology in children's hands and getting them to realise their potential. We also aim to facilitate sessions to include home educated children in the community.

Utilising innovative practice developed here at Ysgol Bryn Elian we aim to deliver first class sessions that inform and educate. Our goal is to reach as many people as possible to raise aspirations across the region, in addition to preparing schools for changes on the educational landscape through sector-leading practice.


To date we have run two highly successful Dojo's, with over 150 children from 20 schools across North Wales taking part. Fun-packed days supercharged with technology ensure all are engaged, having fun, and most of all learning! Impact is of paramount importance to us, as a result of this we seek feedback on every session, the positive comments have been staggering! 

We try to be different at each event, we already have six new activities planned for the next Tech-Dojo (September 2014) where we will create an intruder alarm, use motors to create optical illusions, and create the classic wire-buzz game, all on a Pi that the children will code themselves!

Computing plays such an important role in our daily lives that the school had embedded the subject within its KS3 curriculum before it was even on the Governments educational agenda. The school has delivered transition sessions using Pygame to make Carrie-Anne Philbin's Invader graphics and produced Scratch code to re-create popular games such as Angry Birds and Flappy Bird that really get the children engaged in algorithm design and computational thinking. Now, seeing the fruits of their labour, the school is right at the front of this exciting and innovative area of the curriculum, offering CPD to local Primary Schools in their bid to get skilled up prior to impending changes on the landscape. 



As well as being a teacher, Allen is a certified educator for Raspberry Pi having played a part in the first Picademy, he is now working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation producing teaching materials and plans to offer Pi CPD training across four education authorities in North Wales during the summer. The future looks bright for technological innovation across the North Wales region with places sure to be in demand.
