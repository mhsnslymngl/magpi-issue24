We are currently planning our next Raspberry Pi event "Pi and More 5" in
Trier/Germany. The event will take place on June 28 at the University of
Trier / Campus 2. We will have talks, workshops, and projects using the
Raspberry Pi or other embedded systems. A detailed schedule for the
event will be announced in early June. All information can be found on
our website at http://www.piandmore.de

We are looking for persons or groups who are interested in presenting a
project or a topic at Pi and More 5. We welcome presentations of own or
other projects (e.g., hardware and software projects), or a presentation
of general topics, like first steps with the Raspberry Pi, programming,
system internals, hardware tutorials, etc. Contributions about the
Raspberry Pi are as welcome as contributions about other embedded
systems or microcontrollers. The event aims at beginners and experts
alike. Therefore, simple and small projects fit as well as workshops for
experts.

Please include "Pi and More 5" in the next edition of your "What's On
Guide".

Regards,

Guido Schmitz
